# Rock Paper Scissors

#### .Net MVC app that allows two users to play rock, paper, scissors and returns the winner., 2-14-18

The rules of rock, paper, scissors:

It is played by 2 people. Each person chooses "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" by forming a shape with their hand.
They choose at the same time, so that each person doesn't know what the other person has picked.
If one person chooses "Rock" and the other person picks "Scissors" then "Rock" wins. It's a game of combinations:
Rock v. Scissors = Rock wins
Rock v. Paper = Paper wins
Paper v. Scissors = Scissors wins
If both people choose the same thing, then it is a draw and nobody wins.
